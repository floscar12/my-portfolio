# Hi there!
I am a 21-year-old computer science major with a passion for learning and taking on challenges. Learning and persevering outside of school has allowed me to gain a wide range of skills in modern web application development using JavaScript, ReactJS, and Node.js. I am highly motivated and committed to personal and professional growth, and I enjoy working alongside others to achieve shared goals. I am detail-oriented and committed to producing high-quality work.
